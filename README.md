### Team Roles

Business Analyst (BA)

The Business Analyst is responsible for understanding the client’s business goals and translating them into clear technical requirements. They bridge the gap between the client, product owner, and the development team—ensuring that what’s being built truly meets user needs and business objectives.

Product Owner (PO)

The Product Owner defines the product vision and manages the product backlog. They prioritize features, balance business needs with customer expectations, and ensure the team is always working on tasks that deliver the most value. The PO serves as the key decision-maker for what gets built and when.

Project Manager (PM)

The Project Manager oversees the entire project lifecycle—planning, coordination, resource allocation, and progress tracking. They ensure the project stays on schedule, within scope, and on budget. The PM also facilitates communication across teams and stakeholders, resolving bottlenecks as they arise.

UI/UX Designer

The UI/UX Designer focuses on how users interact with the product. They research user behavior, design wireframes, mockups, and prototypes, and ensure the interface is intuitive and visually appealing. Their goal is to make the product functional, user-friendly, and aligned with business goals.

Software Architect

The Software Architect designs the overall structure of the system. They make high-level decisions about frameworks, programming languages, and integration patterns.

### Feature Breakdown

1. User Management

This feature handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. It ensures that both guests and hosts can securely create accounts, log in, and manage their personal information and activity on the platform.

2. Property Management

Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings through this feature. It allows them to upload details such as location, pricing, and amenities, ensuring that potential guests can easily discover and book suitable accommodations.

3. Booking System

The booking system enables guests to reserve properties, manage check-in and check-out dates, and view booking details. It ensures proper coordination between guests and hosts, preventing double-bookings and maintaining real-time availability.

4. Payment Processing

This feature manages all financial transactions related to bookings. It securely handles payment information, processes payments through supported gateways, and records transaction details for accountability and transparency.

5. Review System

Guests can provide feedback on their stays by leaving reviews and ratings for properties. This helps maintain quality standards, fosters trust within the community, and guides future guests in making informed booking decisions.

6. Database Optimization

This feature focuses on improving backend performance through indexing and caching. By optimizing data retrieval and reducing load times, it ensures the platform remains fast, reliable, and scalable even as the number of users and listings grows.

### API Security

Ensuring the security of the backend APIs is a top priority to protect user data, maintain trust, and safeguard financial transactions. The following key security measures will be implemented:

1. Authentication

All users must securely authenticate before accessing protected endpoints. The system will use secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth to verify user identity.
Why it’s important: Protects user accounts and personal information from unauthorized access, ensuring that only legitimate users can interact with the platform.

2. Authorization

Different users have different access levels (e.g., guests vs hosts vs admins). Authorization ensures that users can only perform actions permitted for their role.
Why it’s important: Prevents unauthorized modifications to sensitive data, such as other users’ bookings, property listings, or payment information.

3. Rate Limiting

API requests will be monitored and limited to prevent abuse or denial-of-service attacks. Rate limiting ensures that no single user or bot can overwhelm the backend services.
Why it’s important: Protects system stability and ensures fair usage, preventing service outages and maintaining a smooth experience for all users.

4. Data Encryption

Sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information, will be stored securely using encryption techniques like hashing and SSL/TLS for data in transit.
Why it’s important: Ensures that even if data is intercepted or breached, it remains unreadable and unusable by attackers.

5. Input Validation & Sanitization

All user input will be validated and sanitized to prevent common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and malicious payloads.
Why it’s important: Protects the database and backend from security vulnerabilities that could compromise user data or system integrity.

6. Secure Payment Handling

Payment endpoints will follow PCI DSS guidelines and integrate secure payment gateways to process transactions.
Why it’s important: Ensures financial data is safely processed, reducing fraud risks and maintaining trust between guests and hosts.

### CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. A CI/CD pipeline ensures that new code changes are automatically tested and deployed to production or staging environments, reducing manual errors and speeding up development.

For this project, CI/CD helps maintain high code quality, ensures consistent deployment of the backend services, and allows new features or bug fixes to reach users quickly and safely.

Tools

GitHub Actions: Automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying code whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

Docker: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production by containerizing the application.

Celery & Redis: Used for handling asynchronous tasks and background jobs reliably in the pipeline.

PostgreSQL: Works with migrations and automated testing within the CI/CD process to ensure database consistency.
